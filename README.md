# edgescan-test

There is two branches on this prject: 
  - the #master #one, with all the dependencies updated according to the test specifications, with only the class file modified
  - the #"first_test_version" one, with different dependencies, where the test file has been  modified to use a different syntax, using the same class file as the master.
  
  Both passes all the tests. Good reading.
